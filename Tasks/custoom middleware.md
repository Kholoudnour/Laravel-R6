  1. Create the Middleware
Run the following command to create a middleware class:
bash
Copy code
php artisan make:middleware AdminMiddleware
This will generate a new middleware class located in app/Http/Middleware/.
2. Define the Middleware Logic
Open the newly created middleware file (AdminMiddleware.php) and add your logic. For example, if you want to restrict access to admin routes:
php
Copy code
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class AdminMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        if (auth()->check() && auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {
            return $next($request);
        }

        abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
    }
}
3. Register the Middleware
In Laravel 11, middleware registration is done differently. Open bootstrap/app.php and add your middleware like this:
php
Copy code
use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        $middleware->alias([
            'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\AdminMiddleware::class,
        ]);
    })
    ->create();
4. Apply Middleware to Routes
Open routes/web.php and apply your middleware to the routes that need it:
php
Copy code
Route::middleware(['admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('admin/dashboard', function () {
        return 'Welcome to the admin dashboard!';
    });
});
5. Create a Custom Route File (Optional)
If you prefer organizing routes in a custom file, create a new route file in the routes directory, e.g., teacher.php.
Register this file in the bootstrap/app.php:
php
Copy code
->withRouting(
    web: __DIR__ . '/../routes/web.php',
    teacher: base_path('routes/teacher.php'),
)
Now, Laravel will recognize the middleware and custom routes, allowing you to enforce specific logic or route access permissions easily​ (Tuts Make)​ (Tuts Make).

To ensure that all routes in your custom route file are protected by the verified middleware and to test one of these routes in the browser, follow these steps:

1. Create the Custom Route File
Create a new route file in the routes directory, for example, teacher.php.
2. Define Routes in the Custom Route File
Add routes that are protected by the verified middleware in teacher.php:
php
Copy code
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::middleware(['verified'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('teacher/dashboard', function () {
        return 'Welcome to the teacher dashboard!';
    });

    Route::get('teacher/settings', function () {
        return 'Teacher settings page';
    });
});
3. Register the Custom Route File
In bootstrap/app.php, register the teacher.php file to make Laravel recognize it:
php
Copy code
->withRouting(
    web: __DIR__ . '/../routes/web.php',
    teacher: base_path('routes/teacher.php'),
)
4. Test the Routes in the Browser
After setting up everything, try accessing one of the routes, for example, http://yourdomain.com/teacher/dashboard.
If the user is not verified, Laravel will redirect them to the verification page or return a 403 error, depending on how you've set up your verification process.
Expected Outcome:
If you try to access the route as a non-verified user, Laravel will not allow access and will likely redirect to a route such as /email/verify or show an error message indicating that verification is required.
As a verified user, you should be able to access the route without issues.
This setup ensures that only users who have verified their email addresses can access routes defined in the teacher.php file.
