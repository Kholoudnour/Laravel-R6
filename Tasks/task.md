Definition: The PATCH method is used to apply partial updates to a resource. When you send a PATCH request, you're sending only the changes to the resource, rather than a complete representation.
Usage: Use PATCH when you want to make partial updates to a resource, modifying only specific attributes.
Idempotency: PATCH requests are also idempotent, but they are used specifically for partial updates.
